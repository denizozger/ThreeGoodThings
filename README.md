# ThreeGoodThings


A (soon to be) application that people can share three good things happened on every day that they feel greateful for, because it will make them happy. Inspired by [Action for happiness](http://www.actionforhappiness.org/take-action/find-three-good-things-each-day).

# Requirements

You need to install Node.js version higher than 11 (currently unstable) as it allows to use [ECMAScript Harmony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ECMAScript_Harmony_.286th_Edition.29).

You need to install [Redis](http://redis.io/) data store as well.

# Installation

``` bash
npm install
bower install
```

# Running

```bash
couchdb
redis-server
node --harmony server.js
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

# Contribution

This is a project that I work on in my spare time, which is little. If you are inspired, drop me an email and/or create a pull request.
